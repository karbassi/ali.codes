            <h2>April 17, 2019</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>In this episode we interview Ali Karbassi, founder of We All Code, and Ignite Talks Chicago. We All Code is an educational non-profit that teaches kids aged 7 to 17 how to code through free educational resources and hands-on classes. Ignite Talks Chicago is a fun public speaking event where 10 speakers have 5 minutes to share their passions with the audience, while slides auto-advance behind them every 15 seconds. We discuss the WHY, WHAT, and HOW of Non-profits and touch on entrepreneurship as a whole. You can find out more about Ali Karbassi and his business ventures at <a href="https://weallcode.org">weallcode.org</a> and <a href="https://ignitechi.org">ignitechi.org</a>.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>In episode 340, I chat with Ali Karbassi the founder of We All Code. He talks about why he fell in love with coding, why doing what you love now matters more than figuring it out for life, why he didn't want to just talk about diversity in tech, he wanted to do something about it, why comments make people think they're not good at things, getting kids to code early and how to figure out if they are having a hard time with it or just not liking it, plus his tips on how to start a non profit.</p>
